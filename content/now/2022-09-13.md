I've been working at [Atlassian][atlassian] on the [Trello][trello] team for a year now, but still kind of struggling to find my place on the Frontend Platform team. However, the company culture is so good, there's no reason to look elsewhere!

I basically took the summer of 2022 off from coding and side projects, and [disconnecting][disconnecting] felt so good! I spent time traveling, doing home improvements, and picking up hobbies like reading and riding my [OneWheel][onewheel].

Now that I'm off my break, I'm trying to get back on track with my [goals for 2022][goals]. I've been learning [Remix][remix] with the hope that it will be the foundation for the future [products][products] that I'll build.

I've only been back a week or two, and I've already released [three][remix-starter] [new][plop-helper-includes] [projects][plop-generator-remix-route], updated [another][bg-snippets], and published two [blog][disconnecting] [posts][profiling-node-scripts]. I hope to keep moving forward at a reasonable pace, probably not this fast, while still sprinkling in some enjoyment time here and there.
