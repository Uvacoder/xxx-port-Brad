Brad has a passion of not only learning the newest tech and programming but he also shares that passion with others in his [stream][twitch]. The one thing that stands out besides his passion to learn and share, is his meticulous work ethic and attention to detail, especially with accessibility. I don't see a lot of developers that focus at all on accessibility and Brad does that and that is why I respect him highly as a developer that knows his stuff.
