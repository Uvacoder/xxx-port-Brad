Brad is always looking for areas to improve the code base and new technologies to try. When he finds something promising, he shares it with the team via awesome demos and broader blog posts and templates. He is also always willing to pair, both when blocked and to unblock others. He approaches work with an infectious enthusiasm for the craft, and is always looking for innovative new ways to work.
