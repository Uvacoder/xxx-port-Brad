I reached out to Brad to start a conversation and see if he had advice for someone just starting off their career as a software engineer. Brad went above and beyond anything I had imagined! He offered to speak via video chat and took an entire hour out of his day for me, sent me tons of resources and links to help answer any questions I had, and even gave me a referral. He really is a wonderful person and a great mentor, I hope I get the opportunity to work with him some day.
