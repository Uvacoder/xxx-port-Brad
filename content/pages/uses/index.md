# üí† uses

As a [developer][developer] and [tech][tech] lover in general, I use a lot of physical and digital stuff on a daily basis.
These things serve many purposes. They bring me enjoyment, connect me to other people, and serve as tools that help me create software.

I'm constantly improving and upgrading my setup, so expect this to change in the future.

If you want to know more details or have any questions, ask me in my [AMA][ama].

## üè† home office

I use my home office as a place to stream, play games, and work on personal projects. This setup is based around a custom built [NZXT][nzxt] themed Windows PC!
