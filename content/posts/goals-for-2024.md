After coming off a pretty relaxed, but successful [2023][2023], I want to push my boundaries a bit this year and get out of my comfort zone. I want to do this all while staying the course of where I'm headed.

## 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨 marriage

Last year was great for my wife and I, we are feeling more open and connected than ever before. This year we want to push our boundaries a bit and spend our date nights doing things we don't normally do.

Instead of just going out [dancing][dancing], this year we want to branch out and go bowling, play basketball, throw axes, or play some games. Doing out of the box things together should create some fun new memories for us, and encourage us to keep things interesting and adapt to new situations together.

## 🏃🏼‍♂️ fitness

Over the holidays I ate way too much, didn't exercise as much as I wanted, and fell back into the pattern of pouring a [whiskey][whiskey] every night. So going into 2024 I want to refocus on health.

My first goal is to only drink with others, not when I'm just sitting alone on the computer at night. Sticking to drinking socially should reduce my alcohol consumption, especially during the weekdays, which will keep me more productive.

I also want to lean into running this year. My big goal is to complete my first ever half marathon, in under two hours. I'm targeting the [Dallas Skyline Half Marathon][half-marathon] on April 20th. It'll be cool to run through a different city with some awesome views.
