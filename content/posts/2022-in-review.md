As the year winds down, it's the perfect time to reflect on everything I've accomplished. It's also a good time to see if I lived up to my [goals for 2022][2022], so let's get into it!

## üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë® marriage

My wife and I are always striving for the best marriage, and this year was no exception. We spent a lot of time at the beginning of the year playing games together. Even though we bought plenty of [adult games][exploding-kittens], the one that turned out to be the most fun for us was [Trouble][trouble]! It was just the right amount of skill, luck, and competition to keep us on the edge of our seats.

They say that year seven is the hardest year of marriage, and I would say that proved true for us. I travelled more than normal for conferences and work, and it was a big adjustment for us. Our monthly marriage checkups always helped us share how we felt and they turned into great conversations about how we could improve.

## üë®üèº‚Äçüíª products

I had a goal to build two SaaS products this year to earn some passive income. I started by building a [SaaS application template][next-saas] with `Next.js`. Then I tried to find some product ideas on Twitter and got nowhere.

After researching a few of my own ideas and hitting brick walls, I lost interest in this goal. I think this process burned me out a little, and caused me to [disconnect][disconnecting] for the summer.

I am still interested in building some kind of SaaS application, but this time with my [Remix starter][remix-app]. I plan to pick up on this goal again in 2023.

## üìö books

I had planned to read six books this year, one every other month. But I went above and beyond this goal and wound up reading nine books this year!

-   [Atomic Habits][atomic-habits]
-   [Getting Things Done][getting-things-done]
-   [Deep Work][deep-work]
-   [Digital Minimalism][digital-minimalism]
-   [Steal Like An Artist][steal-like-an-artist]
-   [Show Your Work][show-your-work]
-   [Keep Going][keep-going]
-   [Hell Yeah Or No][hell-yeah-or-no]
-   [The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fuck][not-giving-a-fuck]

Not only that, I got super into it and ordered five more books that I'm planning to get through next year. But I did feel like the every other month schedule was a little constricting, so I'll be more free with starting new books.

## üè° bradgarropy.com

I successfully completed a major overhaul of this website in February. I [migrated to Next.js][migrating-to-nextjs] and switched hosting over to Vercel. This resulted in faster builds, better web vitals insights, improved TypeScript support, and an awesome developer experience.

However, I was captivated by [Remix][remix] and [Tailwind][tailwind] this year and I've already got branches in progress to migrate to those tools.

Remix restores the client / server relationship and is just flat out _simpler_ to work with. It also provides much needed support for server side data mutations with progressively enhanced `<form>` elements, instead of leaving you hanging on the client side like Next.js does. Tailwind pairs nicely with remix and offers a minimal file size, built in design tokens, and incredible CSS intellisense.

While this started as me just test driving a shiny new framework, I was able to build an entire authenticated application in an afternoon on Remix. You just can't argue with that!
