As I [migrated][migrating-to-nextjs] this site to [Next.js][nextjs], I upgraded Google Analytics from Universal Analytics to [Google Analytics 4][ga4]. Along the way, the resources I found for handling this upgrade were a little outdated. So here's my take on how to integrate Google Analytics 4 with Next.js.

https://youtu.be/m7oQSA3c31Q

## üè° create a property

First, go to your Google Analytics dashboard and click on the _Admin_ cog in the bottom left. From there, click the blue _Create Property_ button. By default, this will create a Google Analytics 4 property. Then answer a few more questions about your business, and click _Create_.

![create property][ga-create-property]

Next you'll be asked to set up a data stream on which to collect analytics information. We'll be using the _Web_ platform.

![data stream][ga-data-stream]

Then fill in the the information they ask about your website and give your stream a name. Then you can click _Create Stream_.

![website][ga-website]

Now you'll be presented with your _Measurement ID_. Copy this value, as we'll be using it to initialize the `gtag` script on your site.

![measurement id][ga-measurement-id]

## üìú initialize the script

Now that you have your _Measurement ID_, I suggest placing it in an environment variable. While the _Measurement ID_ is publicly viewable in the browser, I find that abstracting it one layer can discourage abuse. I use Vercel for hosting, and they have some nice documentation on how to set [environment variables][vercel-env].

Initializing Google Analytics on your site is a two step process. First you'll have to download a script, then execute an initialization function. We can leverage the Next.js `<Script>` component for both steps.

First, download the `gtag` module by placing a `<Script>` component in your custom `_app.js` file. This should use the `afterInteractive` strategy so it does not increase the initial page load time.

```typescript
<Script
    strategy="afterInteractive"
    src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${measurementId}`}
/>
```

Then use another `<Script>` component to initialize the `dataLayer` and connect it to your `measurementId`. Again, this will use the `afterInteractive` strategy to avoid increasing page load time.

```typescript
<Script id="google-analytics" strategy="afterInteractive">
    {`
        window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
        function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
        gtag('js', new Date());
        gtag('config', '${measurementId}');
    `}
</Script>
```

That's it! Most other articles I read included other steps, like responding to route changes, but Google Analytics 4 does not need that in Next.js applications.

## ‚úÖ confirming it works

To ensure that everything is running properly, you can check a few things. First, the _Network_ tab should include a request to retrieve the `gtag` script with the following url.

```
https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=<measurement-id>
```

Next, go to the _Console_ and check for the `window.dataLayer` object. It should be an array where one of the entries contains your `measurementId`.

Finally, change routes inside of your application, then double check the `window.dataLayer` object. You should see additional `gtm.historyChange` events being added to the array.

## üì¶ custom package

If you're like me, and you never want to think about setting this up again, you can use the [@bradgarropy/next-google-analytics][next-google-analytics] package I made specifically for Next.js! It simplifies the configuration into a component that accepts your `measurementId`.

```typescript
<GoogleAnalytics measurementId="G-XXXXXXXXXX" />
```
