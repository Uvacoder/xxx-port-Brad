A few months ago, myself and [Bryan Robinson][twitter] were both interviewing for a developer relations position at [Sanity][sanity]. After Bryan deservingly got the job, I asked him to chat about his interview process, and his past experiences in developer relations.

After our informal conversation, I saw that Bryan was looking for guests on the [That's My Jamstack][podcast] podcast, so I volunteered!

This was my first ever podcast, so I was a bit nervous. But [That's My Jamstack][podcast] episodes follow a formula, so I knew exactly what to expect. I even prepared notes and sent them to Bryan ü§£

The episode turned out great! We talked about my side project ([MURPHY][murphy]), cloud databases like [FaunaDB][fauna], and how APIs play a crucial role in the [Jamstack][jamstack]. I especially loved how Bryan allowed me to plug my [Twitch][twitch] channel and [Discord][discord] server.

As I got to speak with Bryan more, I couldn't help but think about creating my own podcast. What do y'all think? Should I add it to the to do list?
