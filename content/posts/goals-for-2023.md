After a very successful [2022][2022-in-review], I'm kicking off the new year with another set of goals. Last year I [disconnected][disconnecting] for about four months in the summer. To avoid that this year, I'm scaling back some of my goals and focusing more on enjoying the process.

## 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨 marriage

My wife and I are starting off the year by reading two marriage books together. We normally don't read any of the same things, so we thought it would spark a lot of conversation to read books about marriage.

-   [The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work][seven-principles]
-   [Eight Dates][eight-dates]

We also want to try new things on our dates to make fun new memories together. From new restaurants like [Suerte][suerte], to fun experiences like [Electric Shuffle][electric-shuffle], we think trying something different together will bring us some excitement!

## 🤝 relationships

Life has gotten very busy since our children started school full time. But no matter how busy things get, I want to make sure I'm investing time those who are important to me. My sister, my friends, and my brother in laws come to mind first. My goal is to get together one on one with at least one person each month.
