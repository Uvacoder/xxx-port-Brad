The minute I learned there was a coding livestream called [Whiskey Wednesday][whiskey-wednesday], I had to [get in on it][interested]. And what perfect timing, because just a few days later the hosts needed a guest that fit my description!

I [responded immediately][response] on Twitter and hit up one of the hosts in the [Learn Build Teach][discord] Discord server. I got the response I was hoping for, and I was in! The topic of the show was about being a self taught developer, which is what I pride myself on. I never spent a dime on my web development education and I've done pretty well for myself so far.

There were six developers on the stream: the hosts [Marc][marc] and [Scott][scott], myself, and three other guests who were self taught as well. [Eddy Vinck][eddy], [Martha Sharpe][martha], and [Ruth Ikegah][ruth] were all at different points in their careers and it was great to hear their learning strategies.

The episode did an amazing job bringing in an audience, and I got plenty of new followers after it aired. So welcome to everyone new, I hope I can teach you something!
