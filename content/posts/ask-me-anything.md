I've been inspired by [Kent C. Dodds][1] lately to grow my online presence as a developer. My favorite thing about him is how he makes himself available to folks who are looking for advice or help.

So I created an AMA platform on [Github][2] similar to his to answer your questions. This idea originated from [Sindre Sorhus][3] (whose website I love üíú), who also curates an [awesome][4] list of [AMAs][5].

So what are you waiting for, [ask me anything][6]!
