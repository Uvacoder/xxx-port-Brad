Often I need to _make things to happen_ in a GitHub Action by calling out to an external service. For example, I want to rebuild a website with a [Netlify build hook][netlify-hook] or a [Vercel deploy hook][vercel-hook].

While you could write a bash script that executes a `curl` command, I find it much easier to use the [webhook-action][webhook-action] by [Joel Male][joelwmale]. Include it in a workflow step with the `uses` key, and add inputs under the `with` key to specify details about the HTTP request.

```yaml
jobs:
    webhook:
        name: "‚òéÔ∏è call webhook"
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: "üé£ webhook"
              uses: joelwmale/webhook-action@2.1.0
              with:
                  url: https://example.com/api/webhook
                  body: '{"name": "Brad"}'
                  headers: '{"authorization": "abc123"}'
```

I did run into one snag though. The `body` and `headers` fields have to be proper `json`, which means the keys and values should be wrapped in double quotes. If you're trying to [use a secret][secrets] in your workflow, they cannot be inside of single quotes. That's because `bash` preserves the literal values of characters within [single quotes][bash-quotes]. In order to get this working, I had to disable [prettier][prettier] and escape the double quotes.

```yaml
# prettier-ignore
headers: "{\"authorization\": \"${{secrets.TOKEN}}\"}"
```
