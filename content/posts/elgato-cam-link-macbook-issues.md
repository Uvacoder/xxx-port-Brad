I recently got an M1 MacBook Pro and found that my [Elgato Cam Link 4k][camlink] was available as a camera source, but not showing any output.

I fixed it by going to the Elgato [downloads][downloads] page and downloading the Camera Hub application. After installing the application, I clicked the icon in the toolbar and selected _Configure Camera Hub_. Then I command clicked (âŒ˜) the menu with the slider icon to open the advanced settings and chose _Isochronous_ for the _USB Transfer Mode_.

So far so good, that fixed any camera issues I had!
