My all time favorite web development podcast is [Syntax][podcast], hosted by [Scott Tolinski][scott] and [Wes Bos][wes]. They put on a [300th episode spectacular][episode] where listeners were invited onto the show to participate!

And lucky me I got to go first! Scott remembered how to pronounce my name and I impressed Wes with my preparedness. So other than a minor audio glitch, things kicked off well. I chose to do three of the four segments: Potluck Question, Sick Pick, Shameless Plug.

## ðŸ¥˜ Potluck Question

_Is [GraphQL Playground][playground] in production considered insecure due to introspection?_

Scott and Wes both disable GraphQL Playground in production. And as it turns out, [Apollo][apollo] disables GraphQL Playground in production environments by default. One listener added that their products allows GraphQL Playground only from a VPN. That's essentially how we addressed the issue at [Adobe][adobe], by creating a new authenticated route for GraphQL Playground to ensure users have authorization first.

## ðŸ¤® Sick Pick

_[5.11 TacTec Plate Carrier][sick-pick]_

I knew I wanted to plug [MURPHY][shameless-plug], so I sick picked this plate carrier to go along with it. The 5.11 TacTec adds some extra resistance to my pull ups, push ups, and cardio. It also fits like a glove and doesn't restrict movement at all. Although the it's pretty expensive, I use the 5.11 TacTec every day and I'm definitely getting my money's worth.

## ðŸ”Œ Shameless Plug

_[MURPHY][shameless-plug]_

After just releasing MURPHY how could I _not_ plug it?! I gave the back story on why I chose to create it, and shared the tech stack I used to build it. Scott was interested in the process of releasing a [PWA][pwa] to the Google Play Store, so I spent a bit time of talking about the process and tools.

It was great seeing [Scott][scott] and [Wes][wes] again, and I'm honored to have been the first guest on the [live show][episode]! Thank y'all so much for doing [Syntax][podcast], it not only educates me and keeps me up to date with web development, but it's also super entertaining. You've built an incredible community that I'm proud to be a part of!
