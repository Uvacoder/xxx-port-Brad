Lately [Next.js][nextjs] has been gaining a lot of steam, and I've been looking for an opportunity to give it a real shot. This website has been a [Gatsby][gatsby] website since its inception, so I created a [branch][branch] and began the conversion process. The conversion is now finished, and it's time to reflect, evaluate, and make up my mind.

## 🟣 gatsby code

gatsby specific code

## 👨🏼‍💻 development environment

nextjs dev server is slow

gatsby build 27secs
gatsby start 24secs
next build
next start

## 🔻 markdown support

markdown parsing more involved

code block line highlighting

syntax highlighting with vscode themes

remark embedder custom transformers

header link icon not showing up

## 🖼️ image component

image component does not blur up

image component in remark

## 📚 content location

content colocation

## 👨🏼‍⚖️ the verdict

chose gatsby

[branch]: https://github.com/bradgarropy/bradgarropy.com/tree/next
[gatsby]: https://gatsbyjs.com
[nextjs]: https://nextjs.org
