Lately I've had the urge to share more of what I do regarding software development. So recently, I started [livestreaming][1] my coding sessions on [YouTube][2].

## 🎤 setup

My setup is nothing fancy. I use a [Razer Kraken][3] to record audio and [OBS][4] to stream video to [YouTube][2]. I don't use a camera to stream video of myself, but I might consider it in the future.

The first upgrade I'll make here is for audio. I've already had to scrap an entire stream due to audio issues. I plan on picking up the [Blue Yeticaster][5] as soon as possible.

## 📚 topics

These streams cover whatever I'm working on at the moment. Currently, it's a [Gatsby][6] + [Shopify][7] e-commerce website for a barbell sleeve company. It's my first paid freelancing gig, and my first e-commerce website, so you'll watch me learn a lot.

## 👍🏼 benefits

Although it's nerve racking, I think streaming provides tons of benefits.

### 🎯 maintain focus

It's easy to stay focused on what you're doing when you are actively talking about it in front of people. Moreover, I can't livestream myself just crusing social media, so it's a great motivator to get to work!

### 👔 interview preparation

During an interview it's common to be asked to solve a coding problem on a whiteboard while narrating your thoughts. This is very similar to coding on stream. Streaming forces me to clearly express my train of thought while solving problems.

I can tell this is an area of improvement for me, as I tend to go mute when I get stumped by a problem.

### 🎓 learn in public

By streaming coding on YouTube, I'm creating content that can help other developers along the way. [@swyx][8] has been my biggest motivator to [#learninpublic][9], and I believe it goes hand in hand with the next benefit.

### 😎 exposure

If I'm able to create content and help other developers, my name will come to mind when folks are looking for _someone_ to do _something_. This could mean new opportunities for me!

## 🎁 wrapping up

I must be getting better at this writing thing, because what I thought was going to be a short post turned into a long one. But here's the bottom line.
