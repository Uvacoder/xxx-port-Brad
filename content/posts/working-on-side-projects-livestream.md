[James Quick][james-quick] needed a last minute guest for his [Twitch][jqq-twitch] stream and I came in clutch to fill the spot! I've been working on a new side project lately called [MURPHY][murphy], and talking a lot about it in the [Learn Build Teach][learn-build-teach] Discord.

The project started as a simple tool to help me time the [murph][murph] workout, but quickly turned into an excuse to learn a bunch of new technologies. I decided to build a fullstack application with [Svelte][svelte], [Tailwind][tailwind], [Stripe][stripe], [FaunaDB][faunadb], and [Netlify Identity][identity].

During the stream I give a walkthrough of the application in it's current state, and share my thoughts about each of the technologies I used. I definitely hit some walls and experienced some frustration while developing this side project, but it helped to push my boundaries and grow my skills. [MURPHY][murphy] isn't finished yet, but you can watch all of my progress on [Twitch][bg-twitch]!
