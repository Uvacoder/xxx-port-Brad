Shortly after [Roman passed][goodbye-roman], we were presented with an opportunity to be a guardian family for a female petite goldendoodle puppy. After a lot of discussion, we decided that getting another dog was the right choice for our family. We always said that we wanted to train our next dog starting as a puppy. So on March 17th, we brought the kids to [Snickers Doodles][snickers-doodles] to pick up our new 8 week old goldendoodle puppy.

Welcome to the family, Charlie Rae!
