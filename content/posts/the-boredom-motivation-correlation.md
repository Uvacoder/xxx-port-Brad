What happens at work often affects my ability to get things done outside of work. If I don't have enough to do at work, if there are too many meetings, or if I'm not being challenged enough, my brain turns to mush. While in this state, it becomes difficult to maintain focus and find the willpower to work on anything. I call this phenomenon the **Boredom / Motivation Correlation**.

In my experience, boredom has a direct negative effect on motivation. It happens in a linear fashion, as boredom increases, motivation decreases. I find myself in these situations when I'm not getting enough focus time or there isn't enough work to keep my output high as I like.

But there is a breaking point. Eventually, I become so bored and unmotivated that I find inspiration and create a project for myself to invest in, and my motivation shoots back up. Typically these projects are personal projects, not work related projects. We can adjust the graph to look something like this.

My motivation can also be affected by being too busy at work, which would be the opposite of boredom. In my case being busy decreases my motivation slower than boredom. I'm still getting things done and feeling productive, but it comes with a high mental cost. Work feels overwhelming, but I'm also knocking out side projects leads in my free time. This high rate of productivity on work and personal projects eventually leads to burnout. With this in mind, we can see the whole picture.

The **Boredom / Motivation Correlation** is a spectrum that shifts every day for me. Some days I'm super productive and highly motivated because taking on a balanced amount of work at the proper challenge. Other days I don't have a full task list or I have too many meetings and all I want to do is check out mentally and play video games. On the days where I do feel unmotivated, I lift weights or go for a run to shake off that feeling, and then spend time with my family to re-energize myself.

Ideally, boredom and busyness would not have any effect on motivation, and the graph would look something like the one above. If you have mastered your motivation levels and broken the correlation, [tweet at me][twitter] and share your tips on how you did it!
