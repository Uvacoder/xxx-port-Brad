What happens at work often affects my ability to get things done outside of work. If I don't have enough to do at work, if there are too many meetings, or if I'm not being challenged enough, my brain turns to mush. While in this state, it becomes difficult to maintain focus and find the willpower to work on anything. I call this phenomenon the **Boredom / Motivation Correlation**.
