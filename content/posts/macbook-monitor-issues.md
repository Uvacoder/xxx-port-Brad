In my current [desk setup][uses], I've got a MacBook Pro plugged into two monitors via HDMI. Every so often, one or both of the monitors will go black for a few seconds. Usually they recover on their own, but sometimes I have to unplug them to bring them back to life.

This was super annoying, but I finally found the fix! The laptop was switching graphics modes in order to conserve power. You can disable this by going to _Settings_, then _Battery_, clicking _Options_, and then turning off _Automatic graphics switching_.
