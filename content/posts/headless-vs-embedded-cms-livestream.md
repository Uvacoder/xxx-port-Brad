I didn't know who [James Quick][james-quick] was until I took the [Fullstack React & Firebase][tutorial] tutorial on [Level Up Tutorials][lut]. The course was great, and I wanted additional content so I found his [Twitch channel][twitch].

He seemed like an approachable guy, and typically he only had a few people in his Twitch chat, so I jumped right into the conversation. Lucky for me his stream schedule fit perfectly with my work and family schedule, so I was hanging in the chat every time he went live.

After getting to know each other's areas of expertise, we found that we overlapped quite a bit in the [Jamstack][jamstack], [SSG][ssg], and [CMS][cms] space. And as it turns out, I recently migrated to an embedded CMS, and he migrated to a headless CMS. We thought it would make for an interesting stream, so we recorded our conversation about it.

I really appreciated the opportunity, and I had a blast being a guest on stream! It helped advance my public speaking skills, and helped to grow my own audience as well. I've been [streaming][stream] myself, and getting more involved with the developer community on Twitch is a goal of mine. One day I'll have to have James as a guest on my stream to talk about authentication!

If you didn't know, James is working on a new course called [React and Serverless - Fullstack Development][course]. I'm about halfway through it right now and I can say it's very comprehensive, and he shows you every step along the way. Go check it out, it'll be available on May 27!
