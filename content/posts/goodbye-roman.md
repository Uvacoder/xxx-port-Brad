Today I said goodbye to my dog, Roman. I adopted him when he was 3 years old and had him for 13 years. He lived with kidney disease for a while until it failed on him a few days ago.

I got Roman in 2010 right after I graduated from college. He was with me back when I was skinny and single. We would go hiking, kayaking, and take late night walks. I feel like he and I looked alike back then.

Then I got married, and Gaby treated him as if he was her own. Roman loved Gaby, she was the only one that he would let carry him. We lived together in a tiny apartment, where we took lots of walks to let him outside.

Soon enough we had started a family. Roman was so patient and tolerant of the kids when they were little, and the kids took comfort in having him around. His presence was always noticed in the kitchen, around the table, and in his spot in the corner of the living room.

Despite his disease, Roman never let it get him down, and never seemed to complain about it. His last day was tough on all of us. I haven't cried this much in a long time. We showed him so much love, and spoiled him with foods he's never had before.

Thank you Roman for being by my side through all of life's biggest changes. Thank you for accepting Gaby and the kids into your life as I brought them into mine. You were a good boy, my puppers. I'll miss you buddy.
