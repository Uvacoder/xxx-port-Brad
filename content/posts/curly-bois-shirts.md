There was a particularly hysterical moment on a recent episode of [Learn With Jason][learn-with-jason] where [Cassie Evans][cassie-evans] shared her nickname for parentheses with [Jason Lengstorf][jason-lengstorf].

Everyone in chat thought it was super funny, and so did the rest of the web development community. So I thought I would commemorate the moment by creating some tshirts.

This was my first time designing, marketing, and launching a tshirt, so there was a lot to learn. I did much of the design process live on stream, and vetted the concepts with [Twitch][twitch] chat and my [Twitter][twitter] followers. During the design process I got the idea to color the shirts like popular `vscode` themes.

Things got a little spicy here, and I received some great feedback from the creators and the community. After working with each of the creators, I finalized the lineup, sent a few [coming][promo-one] [soon][promo-two] tweets, and then went live on [Cotton Bureau][store].

It's been five days since launch and I've sold 23 shirts. Definitely less that what I was expecting given the large amount of engagement on the [coming soon][promo-one] post. But I learned a lot through this whole process, and now I owe it to myself to create a `bg codes` theme for `vscode`!

_If you purchased a shirt, thank you so much! Don't forget to share a photo on [Twitter][twitter]!_
