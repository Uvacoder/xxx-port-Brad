After doing a detailed comparison of [youtube vs twitch][versus] for streaming, I decided that [Twitch][twitch] was the right place for a developer like myself to set up shop. So here it is, my shiny new [Twitch channel][channel]!

I put a lot of work into the branding, and even [streamed about it][branding]. I'm very happy with the way it turned out, and dare I say there's a chance I could be getting better at design.

Now as some of you know I have a wife and kids, and I'm also dedicated to my fitness. This makes setting a streaming schedule difficult, but here are my _available_ times. This does not mean I will guaranteed be online at each one of these times, but I am typically hitting at least four of these sessions per week.

| Day       |      Time |
| :-------- | --------: |
| Monday    | `10:00PM` |
| Tuesday   | `10:00PM` |
| Wednesday |     `OFF` |
| Thursday  | `10:00PM` |
| Friday    | `10:00PM` |
| Saturday  |  `1:00PM` |
| Sunday    |  `1:00PM` |

That being said, be sure to follow and turn on notifications so you know when I'm hopping on! I'll see y'all in my [Twitch chat][channel]!
