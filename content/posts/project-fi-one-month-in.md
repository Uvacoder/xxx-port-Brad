my bill was six dollars.

I can pretty much end the post here, but I'm going to keep writing anyways üòÅ

I've spent one month with [Project Fi][project-fi] and its been a great experience so far. My bill was low, I had no reception issues, and I got an unexpected suprise from [@BrandonHassler][brandon-hassler].

## reception

Of course the first thing that should be talked about is cell reception. Project Fi uses a combination of Sprint, T-Mobile, and US Cellular towers for their network, and I gotta say, this blows AT&T out of the water. I used to have zero signal in my house, but with Project Fi, I'm all good. Moreover, Project Fi allows me to use WiFi calling on my [Pixel 2][pixel], so calls are crystal clear while I'm connected.

## voicemail

When I was on AT&T I had to download this [cruddy application][voicemail-app] to see my voicemails. Now, voicemail is integrated within the Google's [Phone][phone-app] app just like it should be! Integrations like these make Project Fi feel like home on a Google phone.

## minimizing data

Although Project Fi turns into an unlimited plan after 6gb, it's pay as you go up until then. So you have a huge incentive to use the least amount of data possible. I kept my eyes peeled for open WiFi networks while out with the family on weekends, and Google helps out by automatically connecting you to networks you've joined in the past. I was also conscious of using my phone in the car, no social media scrolling to that eats up data. And for podcasts, I just download the latest episodes to listen to while I'm out.

While this may sound like a lot of micromanagement, it didn't feel that way. I was happy using my phone less in the car, and obviously it's much safer. The times that did require data usage (directions, googling necessary information, etc) didn't cause a big spike.

## the bill

All that being said, I used 0.264gb which brought my bill to **\$26.81**. But out of the blue I noticed I had a \$20 referral credit from none other than [@BrandonHassler][brandon-hassler], bringing my bill down to **six dollars.** I don't know him personally, but I owe him a giant üëçüèº

## referral

On that note, I highly recommend Project Fi, and if you want to try it out, use my [referral code][referral] and we'll _both_ get twenty bucks.
