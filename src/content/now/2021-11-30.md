The second half of 2021 definitely slowed down for me. My job at [Adobe][adobe] completely fell apart after some terrible decisions by my manager, [so I left][peace] along with all of the other frontend engineers.

During the time between jobs, my family and I went to [Disney][disney]! Four full days of the parks left us, and our kids, totally exhausted. But it was the biggest trip we've ever taken.

I started my new job at [Atlassian][atlassian] right after we got back. It's my first fully remote job, so the [onboarding process][remote] was definitley different.

I gained a lot of stability once the job transition was complete, and I was able to refocus on fitness. I set a goal for myself to finish the [Pflugerville Pfun Run][running], a local 5k, to prove that my achilles was fully healed. During the race, I tripped and fell, and my wrist hasn't been the same since. My recovery time is slowing down, and it's making me feel old. At least I kept up a `7:40` pace for run, not bad.

Ramping up at a new job meant less energy for side projects. However, I was able to post a few [new videos][videos] to YouTube, start a [newsletter][newsletter], and [cable manage][desk] my standing desk.

[Richard][richard] and I decided to put [Wev Dev Weekly][wdw] on hold for December, and I've been taking it easy by playing games like [Destiny 2][destiny] and [Halo Infinite][halo].
